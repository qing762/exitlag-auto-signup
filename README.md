# ExitLag auto signup

A tool that auto fetch a temporary email address and creates an account at https://exitlag.com/

## How it works

The process begins by utilizing the [Mail.GW](https://mail.gw/) service to obtain a temporary email address. This email address is then utilized to sign up for an [ExitLag](https://exitlag.com) account. Subsequently, another request is made to [Mail.GW](https://mail.gw/) to retrieve the email confirmation link. Upon activation of the account, the user is able to log in to the ExitLag application and benefit from its functionality.


## Features

- Be able to prompt to change to your own password instead of using the default one.
- Bypass Cloudflare's bot check.
- The script does all the job itself, including the captcha (which in the past you need to do it manually)
- Able to choose between email service provider

> **Warning**
> It is important to note that excessive usage of this tool may result in rate limiting by the API or, in severe cases, IP blocking. To avoid these potential consequences, it is recommended to limit the number of usage. (Maybe 5 times every 10 minutes?)

## FAQ
#### Why did you create this?

Due to persistent high ping of over 100 while participating in online gaming sessions with my peers, I frequently experienced disconnections from game servers. However, after utilizing ExitLag, my ping was reduced to a more manageable level of 40+. Despite the positive outcome, I was dissatisfied with the cumbersome sign-up process. As a result, I elected to develop a custom code solution that would automate this process, also eliminating the need for monetary expenditure.

#### Is it bannable?

I'm not sure but mostly it is as it bypasses Cloudflare's bot check as well as Google's Recaptcha.
